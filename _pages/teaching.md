I started working as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Georgia Tech's
CS 2110 (Computer Organization and Programming) with the Fall 2017 semester under
Prof. Bill Leahy, and I am presently continuing my work in this capacity.

### CIOS Survey Results: Overall Effectiveness
* Fall 2017: 97.3% *(4.87 / 5.00)*
* Spring 2018: 94.6% *(4.73 / 5.00)*
* ** Cumulative: 96% *(4.80 / 5.00)* **

## Georgia Tech - CS 2110 - Computer Organization and Programming

CS 2110 Computer Organization and Programming is a 2nd year CS course offered
at Georgia Tech, with a curriculum starting with simple digital logic, building
up the architecture of a modern computer step by step, with steps including
finite state machines, a simple microprocessor (the LC-3), and low-level C
programming on the GameBoy Advance.

TA responsibilities for this course include teaching three hours of "lecitations"
(a portmanteau of lab - recitations, recitation sessions where students are
expected and taught to complete programming lab assignments) weekly, as well as
holding office hours, preparing homework assignments, (paper) quizzes and "timed
labs" (in-recitation programming quizzes), as well as grading submissions for
all of the aforementioned assignments.

### Course Objectives
1. To understand the structure and operation of a modern computer from the ground up.
2. Understand basic hardware concepts: digital circuits, gates, bits, bytes, number representation
3. Understand the Von Neumann model and the structure and operation of a basic data path
4. Understand the structure and function of machine language instructions
5. Understand the structure and function of a symbolic assembly language
6. Understand basic concepts of computer systems such as the runtime stack, simple I/O devices
7. Introduce the C language with particular emphasis on the underlying assembly and machine
language as well as interaction with hardware.

### Course Outcomes
* Be able to identify and/or construct basic digital structures such as
MOS FET logic gates, decoders, multiplexors, adders, memory.
* Be able to construct a state machine diagram and then implement it
as a finite state machine circuit.
* Understand data representation. Be able to convert numbers
between various representations: Binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal, and IEEE Floating Point.
* Be able to identify the component parts of the Von Neumann Model
of computer and be able to explain the purpose of each component.
* Be able to write, debug and run assembly language programs including
recursive subroutines, traps, basic input/output.
* Be able to write, debug and run multi-file C programs several
hundred lines long using "make" to compile and execute said programs.
* Be able to utilize (in C programs) proper typing and casting constructs,
structs, pointers and arrays, functions, function pointers, dynamic memory allocation and
variables of different storage classes (auto, static, volatile, etc.)
