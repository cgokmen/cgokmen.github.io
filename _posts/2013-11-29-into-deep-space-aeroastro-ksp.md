I&#8217;ve been playing Kerbal Space Program for a while now, and in different saves and using different mods I&#8217;ve pretty much been to every planet out there and back. However seeing how many hours I&#8217;ve spent playing this game, what I have in hand at this moment is very little &#8211; therefore I decided to make a complete roadmap for what I want to do in Kerbal Space Program and then I&#8217;ll simply stick to it and update it when necessary.

Starting now, I&#8217;m going to write this series called &#8220;**AeroAstro**&#8221; in which I will publish my achievements in Kerbal Space Program with my fictional space program of the same name. You can find my initial objectives as well as my mod list below:

**AeroAstro Primary Objectives**

The primary objectives of the AeroAstro program are aimed to set up a Kethane mining & transfer network which will help fuel future spacecraft that are headed for the other planets of the solar system.

  * Design & Test Orbital Crew & Cargo Vehicle
  * Design Light, Heavy and Super-Heavy Launch Vehicles
  * Design & Assemble Kethane Capable Kerbin Space Station
  * Design & Launch Kethane Mapping Satellites to the orbits of Kerbin and its moons
  * Design & Install Permanent Kerbal Settlements (**Bases!**) on Mun and Minmus at Equatorial Kethane Reserves
  * Design, Launch & Land Kethane Miners for Mun & Minmus
  * Design, Launch & Operate Kethane Cargo Vehicles to carry Kethane from the moons to Kerbin Stations

**AeroAstro Modification List**

I&#8217;m only making a list of mods I&#8217;m using at this moment &#8211; I&#8217;m probably going to end up adding a few more in order to create a few more objectives to achieve.

  * MechJeb
  * Deadly Reentry
  * Bobcat&#8217;s Soviet Pack
  * Kethane
  * Kerbal Joint Reinforcement
  * Kerbal Alarm Clock

Summing it up, I&#8217;m going to be spending some more time working on this project. For this first time I&#8217;m sticking to sandbox mode, however I&#8217;ll be back soon with a new program with Career mode, a modified tech tree, and of course, realism mods like ECLSS. **Stay tuned!**
