It's so nice to have you back where you belong ;)</p>
<p>I've never been a fan of ordinary "Hello, World" introductions, hence the Louis Armstrong. Welcome to my brand new personal blog. Iâ€™m not much of a blogger, but I will try my best this time, trying to add blog posts every week when possible.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and be sure to check this place regularly.</p>
