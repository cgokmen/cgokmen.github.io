I'm a third-year Undergraduate Student majoring in Computer Science at the
Georgia Institute of Technology, originally from Istanbul, Turkey.

I work as an undergraduate researcher, advised by Prof. Dana Randall, on
stochastic algorithms for *self-organizing particle systems*, an abstraction of
programmable matter. My work includes creating and simulating distributed
algorithms based on Markov chains, as well as proving properties of these
algorithms. Be sure to visit my [Research Page](/research/) for
more information about our work and publications. My undergraduate thesis
will be available here Fall 2018.

I am also Senior TA for CS 2110, Computer Organization and Programming, under
Dan Forsyth. Since Fall 2017 I have been working as part of this team that
teaches labs & recitations, prepares exams and quizzes and produces homework
assignments. I was promoted to Senior TA for Fall 2018, and put in charge
of planning & supervising course materials and assessments. More about my
teaching work is available on my [Teaching Page](/teaching/).

Finally, I am a collaborator on *zucchini*, an open-source autograder
framework for use in programming courses, and I am the author of a number of
open-source projects such as *particles*, our research project simulator;
*Coban*, a Turkish TV show aggregator; as well as a host of Minecraft and MTA
plugins and other works. You can find more about these in my
[Portfolio](/portfolio/).

Details about my research adventures as well as other ramblings about
technology can be found in my [blog](/blog/), with the most recent articles
available at the bottom of this page.
