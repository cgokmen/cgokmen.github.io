Hi! I'm Cem (pronounced Jem - Turkish phonetics!), I'm currently a Computer
Science Master's Student at Stanford University, working on the Artificial
Intelligence concentration. I am currently working as a researcher at the
[Stanford Vision & Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) and as a Course Assistant for
[CS107: Computer Organization and Systems](https://cs107.stanford.edu).

At SVL, I'm working with Prof. Silvio Savarese and Prof. Fei-Fei Li on
[iGibson](http://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/) & iGATUS, a simulation environment
and a set of common household tasks for training and evaluating embodied learning
models. Our current research goals include the investigation and application of
state-of-the-art computer vision and reinforcement learning models for
establishing meaningful baselines on difficult household robotics tasks such as
cooking, cleaning, and interactive navigation.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Google, on the YouTube Premium
team in San Bruno, CA. There I worked on full-stack projects including Python
and C++ backends and iOS/Android/Web frontends, aiming to bring better benefits
and higher value to the YouTube Premium subscription product.

Before Google, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Georgia
Tech between 2016 and 2018, concentrating on Theoretical CS and AI. During this
time, I spent some semesters in part-time and full-time roles as an
[Undergraduate Researcher](/research/) and Senior [Teaching Assistant](/teaching/).

My work as an undergraduate researcher, advised by Prof. Dana Randall, was on
stochastic algorithms for *self-organizing particle systems*, an abstraction of
programmable matter. My undergraduate thesis, titled _Markov Chain Algorithms for
Emergent Phenomena in Self-Organizing Particle Systems_, is available
[here](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/60893) on
Georgia Tech's thesis database. Visit my [Research Page](/research/) for more
information about our work and publications.
