Hi! I'm Cem (pronounced Jem - Turkish phonetics!), I'm currently a Computer
Science Ph.D. Student at Stanford University at the
[Stanford Vision & Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) advised by Prof. Fei-Fei Li, and
a Research Scientist Intern at NVIDIA Research advised by Dr. Jim Fan, Dr. Yuke Zhu & Dr. Anima Anandkumar.

My research focus is developing methods and platforms to support the development of robotic
agents that can successfully support humans in our everyday activities. 

My recent work includes [BEHAVIOR](http://behavior.stanford.edu), a benchmark and simulation
environment for training and evaluating embodied learning models on long-horizon household activities.
Our latest publication on this series of work, BEHAVIOR-1K, was nominated for a **Best Paper Award** at
CoRL 2022.

Nowadays I'm working on applying state-of-the-art computer vision and robot learning
methods (IL/RL) as well as LLMs to establishing meaningful baselines on difficult household robotics
tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and interactive navigation.

Previously, I was an AI Resident at Google X / Everyday Robots, and Software Engineer
at Google on the YouTube Premium team. At X, I worked on improving learning-from-demonstrations
methods to make robots better at performing everyday tasks. At YouTube, I worked on
full-stack software projects including Python and C++ backends and iOS/Android/Web frontends,
aiming to bring better benefits and higher value to the YouTube Premium subscription product.

Before Google, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Georgia
Tech between 2016 and 2018, concentrating on Theoretical CS and AI. During this
time, I spent some semesters in part-time and full-time roles as an
[Undergraduate Researcher](/research/) and Senior [Teaching Assistant](/teaching/).

My work as an undergraduate researcher, advised by Prof. Dana Randall, was on
stochastic algorithms for *self-organizing particle systems*, an abstraction of
programmable matter. My undergraduate thesis, titled _Markov Chain Algorithms for
Emergent Phenomena in Self-Organizing Particle Systems_, is available
[here](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/60893) on
Georgia Tech's thesis database. Visit my [Research Page](/research/) for more
information about our work and publications.
