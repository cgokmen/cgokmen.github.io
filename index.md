Hi! I'm Cem (pronounced Jem - Turkish phonetics!), I'm currently a **CS PhD Candidate at Stanford, specializing in Embodied AI and Robotics** at Stanford University at the
[Stanford Vision & Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) advised by Prof. Fei-Fei Li.

I develop machine learning algorithms enabling robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in real-world environments. My research includes learning from demonstrations, reinforcement learning (RL), sim-to-real transfer, and leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vision models (VLMs) for robotics.
